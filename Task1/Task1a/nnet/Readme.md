# Problem Statement:
To classify digits with a 2-Layer Neural Network using MNIST dataset.
# Objective:
The task requires you to code, from scratch, all parts of a two layer neural network to train and predict digits given images. We will make use of PyTorchâ€™s Tensor API only to implement all the core neural network operations and algorithms.
