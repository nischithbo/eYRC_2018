You are given an image similar to the arena image. It has the same geometric structure like theme arena as seen in its top view. The problem you solve here is to find non-empty (Animal and Habitat locations) squares from the given arena image and also mark their location according to arena location convention.
Along with that you should also be able to copy whatever there is in this non-empty Animal or Habitat locations as separate image files.
