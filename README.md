Theme - Homecoming.
The arena for the theme is an abstraction of an ecosystem in a grid-form. The goal is to devise an
autonomous robot to negotiate a path on the arena to visit the Animals and Habitats and to identify
them using Machine Learning algorithms. It then picks up the identified Animals and places them
in their respective Habitat on the arena.
The challenges and learnings in this theme include Machine Learning for identification (of
Animals and Habitats), sensor interfacing, path planning, and designing of a mechanism for
picking and placing the Animals.
